# Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) — Grades 2, 1, 0 

## General Low‑Grade Testing Principles
- **Grade 2 (gravity‑minimized):** Full available ROM in a position where the segment moves **parallel to the floor** and the limb is **supported** to reduce friction.
- **Grade 1 (trace):** Palpable or visible muscle/tendon activity **without joint movement**; include precise palpation and “find‑it” cues.
- **Grade 0 (zero):** **No** palpable or visible contraction.

# UPPER EXTREMITY

## Scapular Abduction & Upward Rotation — Serratus Anterior
### Grade 2 — Gravity‑Minimized Position
- **Short sitting.** Therapist supports the arm **under the elbow**, holding it **above 90°** so the GH joint is assisted and gravity on the scapula is reduced.

### Grade 0 — Observation
- No activity detected in the serratus region.
### Therapist Cues
- **G2:** “Hold your arm right here.”
- **G1/0:** “Try to hold it here while I support you.”
